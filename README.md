# Human Values Classification in Russian Social Media

This repository contains Python scripts and models accompanying the study:
**"Detecting Basic Values in A Noisy Russian Social Media Text Data: A Multi-Stage Classification Framework"**.

We analyze how human values are expressed in public VKontakte (VK) posts, drawing on Schwartzâ€™s theory of basic human values. Our pipeline includes filtering, GPT-based annotation, and supervised multi-label classification using transformer models.

## Pretrained Models and Embeddings (Zenodo)

Two pretrained artifacts are available via Zenodo:

- **Rubert-tiny2 fine-tuned embeddings** used for binary classification (value-expression detection)
- **XLM-RoBERTa-large model** fine-tuned for multilabel classification of human values

## Getting Started

To reproduce the classification pipeline:

1. Run crawling and preprocessing (see 1\_Crawling\_and\_Preprocessing/)
2. Filter posts using value- and political classifiers
3. Annotate posts with GPT or use `gpt-api-prompt/`
4. Download the pretrained multilabel classification model (XLM-RoBERTa-large) from Zenodo 
   and place it in the `models/` folder.

## Data Availability

* We **do not** publish raw VK post texts due to ethical constraints.
* Hashed IDs, annotations, and aggregated soft labels are provided.
* See `README_data.md` for more.
