# Data Availability and Privacy Statement

This repository accompanies a study on human value classification in Russian-language social media. The dataset used in this study consists of public posts collected from the VKontakte platform via random user ID sampling.

## Data Privacy and Ethics

Although the collected content was publicly available at the time of access, we acknowledge that social media posts may still contain personal or sensitive information. To preserve user privacy and comply with ethical research standards:

- We do **not** publish the original post texts.
- All user and post identifiers were stored in **hashed form**, without any direct links to user profiles.
- Posts were collected together with publicly available user metadata (e.g., age, gender, region), which were used in aggregate analyses only. 

## Access to Full Text Data

The full dataset of post texts is **not publicly available** due to ethical constraints. However, we are committed to supporting the research community. Academic researchers may request access for non-commercial use under a data usage agreement.
